# Harnessing AI to Optimize a Dual GPU Setup: My Journey with MCP and Work Database Integration

## Introduction: The Hardware Challenge

When I first decided to build a system with both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, many considered it a recipe for driver conflicts and endless troubleshooting. Yet here I am, running an ASRock Radeon RX 6600 Challenger for display alongside a Zotac NVIDIA RTX 3050 dedicated to computational tasks - all on Kali Linux with my Ryzen 7 5700X and ASRock X570 Taichi motherboard.

This unusual setup wasn't just a hardware enthusiast's experiment - it was a deliberate architecture designed to separate visualization from computation. But making it work efficiently required more than just proper driver installation; it demanded an intelligent system to manage resources and workflows.

## Enter the Master Control Program (MCP)

Science fiction fans might recognize the term "MCP" from Tron, but my Master Control Program isn't trying to take over the digital world. Instead, it serves as the central nervous system for my dual GPU environment, intelligently directing tasks to the appropriate hardware based on workload characteristics.

The MCP evolved from a simple script to a sophisticated AI-assisted system that:

1. **Monitors hardware performance** - tracking temperatures, utilization, and power consumption
2. **Routes computational tasks** - sending CUDA/ML workloads to the NVIDIA card and keeping display tasks on the AMD GPU
3. **Optimizes thermal management** - adjusting fan curves and throttling intensive processes when temperatures rise
4. **Maintains system logs** - recording performance metrics and usage patterns for analysis

But the real evolution came when I separated the MCP server from the work database.

## The Database Divorce: Separating Concerns

Initially, everything lived in one container - the MCP and its knowledge storage. This created a monolithic system that was difficult to maintain and scale. The separation into distinct containers brought numerous benefits:

1. **Independent scaling** - the database could grow without affecting MCP performance
2. **Better fault tolerance** - issues with one component wouldn't bring down the entire system
3. **Cleaner architecture** - each container focused on what it did best
4. **Improved security** - more granular permission controls

The process wasn't straightforward. Docker configurations needed careful tuning to ensure proper GPU isolation - using `--gpus=device=1` for NVIDIA workloads and `/dev/dri` mappings for AMD access. Permission issues between containers required creative solutions with shared volumes and proper user mappings.

## The Work Database: More Than Just Storage

What makes the work database special isn't just that it stores information - it's that it serves as a collaborative interface between human and AI. It maintains:

- **Knowledge articles** - documenting solutions to recurring problems
- **Code snippets** - storing reusable code for common tasks
- **Command history** - tracking effective command sequences
- **Hardware profiles** - maintaining detailed component information
- **Performance logs** - recording system behavior under various workloads

This isn't merely a passive repository; it's an active participant in the workflow. When the MCP encounters an unusual temperature spike, it can query the database for similar past incidents and their resolutions. When I'm working on a new project, both the MCP and I can access the same knowledge base.

## Collaborative Intelligence: Human + AI

The real power of this setup emerges from the partnership between human expertise and AI assistance. The system learns from my decisions and I learn from its analysis. Some examples:

- When testing different CUDA configurations, the MCP tracked performance across multiple approaches while I focused on output quality
- During thermal optimization, I established target temperatures while the MCP continuously adjusted fan curves to maintain them
- For ML training jobs, I defined the algorithms while the MCP managed resource allocation and queuing

This symbiotic relationship creates a feedback loop where both human and AI continuously improve. The work database serves as our shared memory, allowing knowledge to persist and grow over time.

## Practical Benefits in Daily Work

This isn't just a technically interesting setup - it delivers tangible benefits:

1. **Resource efficiency** - compute-intensive tasks never compete with display processes
2. **Thermal stability** - intelligent load balancing prevents thermal throttling
3. **Workflow optimization** - automated routing of tasks to appropriate hardware
4. **Knowledge retention** - solutions aren't forgotten after they're discovered
5. **Continuous improvement** - system becomes more effective over time through learning

## The Journey, Not Just the Destination

Implementing this system wasn't a linear process. It involved numerous iterations:

1. **Initial struggle** - Getting both GPUs recognized properly under Linux
2. **Driver conflicts** - Resolving interactions between AMD and NVIDIA drivers
3. **First automation** - Simple bash scripts to monitor temperatures
4. **MCP genesis** - Developing the first version of the control program
5. **Database integration** - Adding persistent storage for configurations and logs
6. **Containerization** - Moving components into Docker for better isolation
7. **Component separation** - Splitting MCP and database into distinct containers
8. **Optimization phase** - Fine-tuning the entire system for reliability and performance

Each step brought new challenges and insights. For instance, PCIe bandwidth allocation required careful planning to ensure the compute GPU wasn't bottlenecked while the display GPU maintained smooth performance.

## Looking Forward: Future Enhancements

This system continues to evolve. Planned improvements include:

1. **Predictive thermal management** - Using ML to anticipate thermal issues before they occur
2. **Workload classification** - Automatically categorizing tasks for optimal routing
3. **Power optimization** - Dynamically adjusting power limits based on workload demands
4. **Expanded knowledge integration** - Connecting the work database to external knowledge sources

## Conclusion: The Sum Greater Than Its Parts

Building this dual GPU system with AI-assisted management has been more rewarding than I initially expected. What started as a hardware experiment has evolved into a platform that enhances productivity and provides continuous learning opportunities.

The integration of the MCP server and work database demonstrates that the boundary between tool and collaborator can blur in productive ways. As AI capabilities continue to advance, I expect this partnership to grow even more powerful, enabling workflows that neither human nor machine could achieve alone.

For anyone considering a similar setup, my advice is simple: think beyond the hardware. The true potential lies not just in having powerful components, but in creating intelligent systems that help you use them effectively.
